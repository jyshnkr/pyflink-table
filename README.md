# Flink
Apache Flink is an open-source, unified stream-processing and batch-processing framework. It provides a high-throughput, low-latency streaming engine as well as support for 
event-time processing and state management. Its applications are fault-tolerant in the event of machine failure and support exactly-once semantics.It does not provide its own data-storage system, but provides data-source and sink connectors to systems such as Amazon Kinesis, Apache Kafka, HDFS, Apache Cassandra, and ElasticSearch
